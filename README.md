# C4 JavaScript Quiz

## Challenge 4 in MSU Bootcamp

This project creates a quiz about JavaScript fundementals for students who are learning the language. As a bootcamp student I've found these type of quizes to be helpful to retain basic fundementals of the current topic. I think it's also important to have a sense of your understanding of such topics compared to your peers which the high scores page supplies. With the seperate questions.js file it makes it very easy for a developer to change the questions/answers as he or she chooses. A developer can easily change the time allowed as well as the results of choosing a correct or incorrect answer. Through building this project it helped tighten up my HTML/CSS skills and learn to implement newer JavaScript concepts to me such as Event Listeners and Local Storage.

## Usage

The homepage clearly states the rules of the quiz, presents the amount of time available to complete the quiz, and a link to view high scores. The timer and view high scores link is available through the duration of the quiz. Once the user presents the 'Let the challenge begin!' button the first multiple choice question is displayed with buttons for four possible answers. Once a choice has been made the page will display 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' for 1.5 seconds before the next question is presented. If a correct answer was chosen the user is awarded 10 points, if not 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. The quiz ends once the user has answered 5 questions or the timer reaches zero, at which point the users score is displayed and the user is prompted to enter their initials. Once the user enters their initials and clicks on the submit button they are taken to a page that will display their score and the scores of their peers. The user can then click on the 'restart quiz' button to take at again or click on the 'clear highscores' button to clear the highscores. Screenshots below.
